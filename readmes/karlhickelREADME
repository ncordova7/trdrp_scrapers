Contributions that I did not get to:
- Store python algorithms on vm to update queries. 
- Create a relational tables to ensure integrity of data. 
- Store more data and run updates on the data. 
- Add everyone to the server to run SQL queries. 

Google Cloud Connection steps:
Connect to server using MySql connector and stored data into pandas data frames. 
To store the data you need to run the python file that utilizes the credentials to connect to the server.
After connecting the script runs a for loop that stores variables in the master Marijuana table. 
Unfortunately due to time constraints we were not able to use a python vm to run a refresh script that updates
our marijuana master file. Our ideal master table would add a last update column that indicates the last time the row
had been inserted into the table. Also due to limiations we were unable to ensure referencial integrity across multiple tables. 
These limitations prevented us from really developing a cohesive ecosystem of referential tables.
