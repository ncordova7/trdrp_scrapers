I am currently in the process of creating a spatial dataset around South
Los Angeles. I will be utilizing crime data along with XY (Longitude/Latitude)
data for dispensary and smokeshop locations to create a point based shapefile to be read into a GIS program.

UPDATE FOR SUBMISSION 3

I am currently testing connections to the SQL server via Tableau and using the data to create a map for poster submission.

 12/3/19 Update:

 Assisted in the development of our team's poster. Created a map of dispensaries in the South Los Angeles area utilizing ArcGIS Online with a connection to our project's server.
